This repository contains the S-412 (Marine Weather Warnings) Product Specification draft and related development documentation to facilitate a mechanism for sharing with external developers. Once a more complete product specification exists, the main repository for the S-412 product specification will reside in the WMO (https://github.com/wmo-im/S-41X-PS) and IHO (https://github.com/iho-ohi) github repositories.


About S-412
S-412 uses polygons in GML format to depict warnings for wind, wave, ice accretion, thunderstorms, and restricted visibility based on criteria defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), International Maritime Organization (IMO) resolutions, and the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).  


Product Specification Components
 - The draft of the S-412 Product Specification can be found in an editable Microsoft Word format (.docx):
     - Intro
     - Annex A - DCEG
     - Annex B - Feature Catalogue
     - Annex C - GML Data Product Format
     - Annex D - Validation Checks
     - Annex E - Normative Implementation Guide
     - Annex F - References
 - Important supplementary files that are embedded within various sections of the product specification are also provided as standalone files:
     - Concept Definitions
     - UML Diagram
     - GML Schema 
 - Initial ideas on portrayals are also provided as a starting point


Additional Context 
 - The development team (primarily weather experts) that drafted this product specification are novices to S-100 and IHO standards. 
 - The WMO approved the provided concept definitions in April 2025. Most concepts were approved in the IHO GI Registry in June 2025. “Beaufort Force” had to be resubmitted and    should be approved in mid-to-late August 2025. 
 - The draft Feature Catalogue was produced manually, without the “Feature Catalogue Builder”.
 - A Portrayal Catalogue draft does not yet exist; however, initial ideas on portrayals are available.


Expectations
 - S-100 product specification experts will assist with improving the draft documentation and ensure its alignment with the latest S-100 edition 5.2.
 - The documentation will be transformed into a more repository-friendly format (e.g., aligned with Metanorma).
