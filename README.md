Marine Weather Warnings are in the form of polygons depicting areas where wind, wave, and ice accretion are ongoing or predicted to meet WMO Pub. No. 558/471 , IMO Resolutions and SOLAS Convention established criteria within a defined period of time. Polygon warning portrayals will provide ample warnings of adverse weather along a vessel's route. For coastal and offshore waters, warning polygons may also be provided for near gale force winds, thunderstorms/squall events, and reduced visibility, also based on WMO Pub. 558.
