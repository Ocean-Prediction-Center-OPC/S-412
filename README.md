This repository contains the documentation for the development of S-412 Marine Weather Warnings. Below is a brief summary of what in encompassed in the porject.
Marine Weather Warnings are in the form of polygons depicting areas where wind, wave, and ice accretion are ongoing or predicted to meet WMO Pub. No. 558/471 , IMO Resolutions and SOLAS Convention established criteria within a defined period of time. Polygon warning portrayals will provide ample warnings of adverse weather along a vessel's route. For coastal and offshore waters, warning polygons may also be provided for near gale force winds, thunderstorms/squall events, and reduced visibility, also based on WMO Pub. 558.

Please note, the development team working on the initial version of this product specification requires further knowledge of general S-100 product specification development and IHO standards. The team expects further improvement to this product specification as experts in those topics provide their assistance.
